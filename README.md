<!-- About Me -->
## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a learner of the ALX **Back-End Web Development** program, and I am currently focused on building robust and secure systems that power web applications.  

💬 I started with software engineering because I’ve always been intrigued by how the internet works behind the scenes—how data moves, how systems communicate, and how small pieces of logic can power entire platforms. I wanted to move from being a user of technology to a creator and problem solver.

✨ What inspires me is the ability to build scalable and reliable systems that solve real problems for people—especially in under-resourced communities where technology can make the biggest impact.

🎯 My aim is to become a highly skilled back-end engineer contributing to open-source projects and developing innovative solutions in areas like education, health, and finance. I want to help build tools that are efficient, accessible, and secure.

👨‍💻 That’s why I would like to work on:
- APIs for high-traffic applications  
- Database design and optimization  
- Automation tools and microservices  
- Open-source back-end projects
